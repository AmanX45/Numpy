NumPy Basics

Welcome to the NumPy basics guide! Below, you'll find instructions on how to install, import, and understand the key features of the NumPy library.

 Introduction to NumPy:

- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python.
- It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- Offers a wide collection of mathematical functions to perform operations on arrays.
- It is widely used in fields like data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

How to Install the Latest Version of NumPy:

To get started with NumPy, you first need to install it. Use one of the following methods:
- Using pip (Python package installer): `pip install numpy `
- Using conda (Anaconda users): `conda install numpy`

 How to Import NumPy:
Once installed, you can import NumPy into your Python script using an alias:
- Import with alias `np`: `import numpy as np`

 What is Alias in Python?

- An alias is a shorthand or nickname for a module, function, or object.
- It is used to simplify your code and make it more readable.
- In NumPy, we commonly use the alias `np` for the `numpy` module. For example, instead of typing `numpy.array([1, 2, 3])`, you can simply use `np.array([1, 2, 3])`.

Dimension of a NumPy Array:

NumPy arrays can have different dimensions. Here are the basic types:
0D (Scalar):   A single value. Example: `np.array(5)`
1D (Vector):   A one-dimensional array. Example: `np.array([1, 2, 3])`
2D (Matrix):   A two-dimensional array (like a table or grid). Example: `np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`
3D (Tensor):   A three-dimensional array. Example: `np.array([[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]]])`

NumPy also supports higher-dimensional arrays, and the dimension is determined by the shape of the array.
